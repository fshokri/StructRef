# StructRef
The complex biological systems can be refined through an iterative refinement
process. Two types of refinement can be implemented on a biological model,
namely data refinement and process refinement. We develop here a software
for the reaction based-models, based on the data refinement method, where
some of its species are substituted with their subspecies. The software is
intended for generating the refined model as output after fetching the original
model. For verifying our software, we take the heat shock response model as
our case study. The software we implement produces the same result as the
case study.
